                I’m Jahid Hasan, a Ph.D. researcher at Purdue University working on building reliable, fair, and trustworthy machine learning systems that actually hold up in real-world deployment. I work with the Responsible Data Science Lab, where my focus is on how data quality, pipeline design, and evaluation choices determine whether an AI system succeeds—or quietly fails—at the deployment phase.

                <br><br>My work primarily addresses a practical problem companies face every day: models often look great during development, but fail after deployment due to changes in the assumptions. Instead of treating this as a model-only issue, I approach AI systems as end-to-end pipelines, where failures often originate upstream in data acquisition, curation, or preprocessing. My research develops concrete ways to diagnose these failures early and fix them through targeted, interpretable interventions—without costly, full-system redesign from scratch.

                <br><br>I’ve built systems that selectively acquire high-impact data to improve fairness and accuracy, identify fragile pipeline components under data drift, and automatically suggest pipeline repairs that align system behavior with business or user goals. I’m also exploring data-diversification strategies for large language models to improve originality and reduce collapse, as well as retrieval-augmented generation systems grounded in reliable, verifiable sources for trustworthy recommendations.
                
                <br><br>I've been under the supervision of the esteemed <a href="https://romilapradhan.github.io/romila/" target="_blank" style="color: #1E90FF; text-decoration: none;">Dr. Romila Pradhan</a> in several <a <href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2237149" target="_blank" style="color: #1E90FF; text-decoration: none;">NSF</a> and <a <href="https://casmi.northwestern.edu/research/projects/data-biases.html" target="_blank" style="color: #1E90FF; text-decoration: none;">CASMI</a> granted projects.  In parallel, I collaborate with the Purdue HCI Research Lab on applied, human-centered projects, including an IRB-approved study that uses motion prediction to reduce collision risk while engaging with VR headset and smart eyewear.

                <br><br>I’m most excited by environments where research meets production—where ideas are tested against messy data, real users, and real constraints. I enjoy working across disciplines and teams to turn responsible AI principles into systems that are practical, measurable, and scalable

                <br><br> Feel free to explore, and don’t hesitate to reach out for collaborations, questions, or discussions!
