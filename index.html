            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am a Ph.D. researcher at Purdue University, specializing in Responsible Data Science, Machine Learning Trustworthiness, Reinforcement Learning, and Data Preparation. My research focuses on developing robust data-driven methodologies that ensure fairness and transparency in machine learning models. With a strong mathematical foundation, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical principles and real-world applications in data-driven decision-making.

                <br><br>My work primarily involves data acquisition, data enrichment, and bias mitigation to enhance the reliability of machine learning algorithms. I develop methodologies to identify, quantify, and mitigate biases in datasets, ensuring equitable outcomes in AI models. Additionally, I explore efficient data acquisition strategies, leveraging statistical and optimization techniques to refine training data and improve model generalization.
                
                <br><br>With a background in mathematics, I bring a rigorous analytical approach to solving complex problems in machine learning and data science. My expertise spans probability theory, optimization, and statistical modeling, which form the backbone of my research in trustworthy and explainable AI. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the broader mission of ethical AI, ensuring that machine learning systems operate with fairness, accountability, and transparency.
